# DiffSinger Vietnamese support

This repo contains phoneme tables for labeling and dictionary files for synthesizing Vietnamese in DiffSinger.

The recommended dialect for recording datasets is Northern, as the majority of pop songs utilize the Northern dialect; But fear not! There are also phonemes enabling support for the Southern dialect.
